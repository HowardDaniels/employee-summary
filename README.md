# employee-summary

Memorizing names and email addresses can be difficult, so this command line application allows employees to enter in their team's info, and access it on a webpage, listing their team members' info, including name, email, and role.

The employees' specific roles are accounted for as well, as managers' office numbers, engineers' GitHub profiles, and interns' current schools will be listed.

The user may enter info into the command line for as many team members as he or she would like, which are all displayed on an HTML document once all team members' info is gathered.
